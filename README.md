# WL2Vec
This project creates a word embedding from Bernard Bolzanoâ€™s Wissenschaftslehre (1838). After preprocessing and filtering stopwords, frequent words, and bigrams, a sparse co-occurrence matrix is constructed. Dimensionality reduction with Truncated SVD produces dense embeddings, allowing exploration of semantic similarity between words in the text.
